        <h2>Bicep Workout</h2>
        <p> Bicep workout focuses on strengthening the biceps, which are the muscles at the front of your upper arms. Common exercises include barbell curls, dumbbell curls, hammer curls, and concentration curls. These exercises target the bicep brachii, helping to build size and strength. For balanced development, it's essential to use proper form and progressively increase weights. Typically, bicep workouts consist of 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise.To maximize gains, rest between sets, maintain a steady tempo, and combine with a balanced overall training regimen.</p>

        <h2>Tricep Workout</h2>
        <p> Tricep workouts focus on strengthening the triceps, the muscles at the back of your upper arms. Common exercises include tricep dips, close-grip bench presses, tricep pushdowns, overhead tricep extensions, and skull crushers. These exercises primarily target the tricep brachii, helping to build muscle size and strength. For balanced muscle development, it's important to use proper form and gradually increase weights. A typical tricep workout consists of 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. To maximize gains, ensure sufficient rest between sets, maintain controlled movements, and integrate it into a comprehensive training program.</p>

        <h2>Chest Workout</h2>
       <p>Chest workouts target the pectoral muscles, primarily the pectoralis major and minor, helping to build strength and size in the chest. Common exercises include bench presses (flat, incline, and decline), push-ups, chest flyes (using dumbbells or cables), and dips. These exercises engage the chest, shoulders, and triceps for balanced upper body development. A typical chest workout involves 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. To ensure optimal results, use proper form, progressively increase weights, and focus on both pressing and stretching movements. Combine with a full-body routine for balanced muscle growth.</p>

        <h2>Back Workout</h2>
       <p>Back workouts focus on strengthening the muscles of the upper, middle, and lower back, including the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, and erector spinae. Common exercises include pull-ups, lat pulldowns, barbell rows, dumbbell rows, deadlifts, and face pulls. These exercises help build back width and thickness while improving posture and overall strength. A typical back workout consists of 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. To maximize gains, use proper form, progressively increase weights, and incorporate both pulling and rowing movements. Pair with a well-rounded training regimen for balanced muscle development.</p>

        <h2>Shoulder Workout</h2>
        <p>Shoulder workouts focus on developing the deltoid muscles, which consist of the anterior (front), lateral (side), and posterior (rear) deltoids. Common exercises include overhead presses (barbell or dumbbell), lateral raises, front raises, rear delt flyes, and Arnold presses. These movements help build shoulder strength, size, and mobility. A typical shoulder workout involves 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per exercise. To maximize results, use proper form, control the weight, and progressively increase resistance. Balance pressing and isolation movements to target all parts of the shoulder, and integrate into a full-body workout plan for overall muscle development.</p>
